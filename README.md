# **MOOC.fi Java Programming Course**

### **Description**
This is University of Helsinkiâ€™s free massive open online course (MOOC) on programming. This is an updated version of their popular course 'Object-Oriented Programming with Java'

During this course, I will learn the basics of computer programming, along with algorithms and object-oriented programming through the Java programming language. The course includes comprehensive materials and plenty of programming exercises - all of which are tested using their automatic testing service Test My Code.

The course is split up into two individual courses: Java Programming I and Java Programming II. Each course consists of seven parts, each with its own exercise set. Completing a single part takes approximately 5-20 hours, depending on prior skills with computers.
