### **Description**
I am undertaking (or have already finished) the University of Helsinkiâ€™s massive open online course (MOOC) on Java Programming. This is an updated version of their popular course 'Object-Oriented Programming with Java'.

During this course, I will learn the fundamentals of software development, algorithms, and object-oriented programming through Java. The course includes comprehensive materials and plenty of programming exercises - all of which are tested using their automatic testing service 'Test My Code' through Netbeans.

The course is split up into two individual courses: Java Programming I and Java Programming II. Each course consists of seven parts, each with its own exercise set. Completing a single part takes approximately 5-20 hours (~220 hours total), depending on prior skills with computers.
